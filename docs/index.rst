Zippy
===================================

This is a reference implementation of a payment processor that would hook into a
`payment provider for navigator.mozPay()`_ such as `WebPay`_.
It shows the API,
endpoints, and authorization formats a payment processor should implement
in order to integrate with the `Firefox Marketplace`_ via `WebPay`_
(and `Solitude`_ behind the scenes).
Hooking into WebPay as a payment processor is much simpler than
implementing a full-on payment provider to spec.

These docs are also available as a PDF: https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/zippypayments/latest/zippypayments.pdf

Rather than being a specification to read, Zippy is a working project. It's
important to note that underneath Zippy does not actually do anything other
than record some transaction information to allow APIs to work. Specifically it
does not:

* try and actually charge carrier billing
* try and charge a credit card
* process any money at all

That is all faked out. It's up to the individual payment processor to implement
that.

Are you interested in how *everything* works? Read about the :ref:`flow`.

Here's how Zippy fits into the `Firefox Marketplace`_ infrastructure.

Everything you need to know about data formats, protocols, authentication and
the like. See the :ref:`using zippy documentation <using-label>`.

payment provider:

* Setting up a developer account so that a developer can recieve payment.
* Registering one or more products with the payment provider.
* Any further configuration that the product needs.
* Confirming that data is all set up correctly.

See the :ref:`developer documentation <developer-label>`.

Payment
~~~~~~~

* The actual payment part of the :ref:`flow <flow>`.
* Starting the payment :ref:`flow <flow>`.
* Pages that should be shown and hosted by the payment provider.
* The result after the payment has been completed.
