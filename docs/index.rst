Zippy
===================================

This is a reference implementation of a payment provider. It shows the API and
endpoints a payment provider should implement in order to integrate with the
Firefox Marketplace.

Zippy was also a character on a children's TV show in the UK.

All the code is on `github <https://github.com/mozilla/zippy/>`_.

About
-----

Zippy shows payment providers how to integrate with the Firefox Marketplace
system. It shows the API calls and formats that the Marketplace will make to
the payment provider, authorization formats and so on.

Rather than being a specification to read, it is a working project. It's
important to note that underneath zippy does not actually do anything other
than record some transaction information to allow APIs to work. Specifically it
does not:

* try and actually charge carrier billing
* try and charge a credit card
* process any money at all

That is all faked out. It's up to the individual payment provider to implement
that.

It is licensed under the Mozilla Public License v2.0 and contributions are more
than welcome.
