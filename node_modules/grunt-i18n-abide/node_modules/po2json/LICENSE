PO parser from http://jsgettext.berlios.de/lib/Gettext.js
adapted for Node.js and modified to be more like po2json.pl
- Zach Carter <zcarter@cse.usf.edu>

Further adapted to be used inside a node.js environment instead of the command line. Import with a require statement:
var po2json = require('po2json.js')
po2json.parse('filename', function(result) {
   on parse complete callaback, result is the json string.
});
