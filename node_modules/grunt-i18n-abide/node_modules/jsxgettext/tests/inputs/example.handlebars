Some {{ gettext "translated text"}} is matched.
But non-translated text is not matched.
Even with a {{ value }} embedded.
Or if it contains the word gettext or even the _ character.
You might also use a {{#gettext}}block helper{{/gettext}} like this.
As long as it is {{#helper}}named properly{{/helper}} of course.
{{! comment strings }} are passed through
{{!-- including long-form {} comments with }} markup in them --}}
Things that {{dont}} {{ pattern match a gettext call}} are ignored.
And spurious { or }} or whatever markup doesn't confuse the parser.
Escaped quotes are ok, {{gettext 'so let\'s test'}} them.
So, do we {{gettext good}}?
