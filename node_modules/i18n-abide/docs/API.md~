# API

The following APIs compliment the core API shown in the [README](../README.md):

## setLocale

You can set locale in the scope of per-request instead of letting `i18n-abide`
decide the locale for you.
The following example shows how to set the locale of the request to `zh_TW`
(Traditional Chinese): 

    exports.homepage = function(req, resp) {
      req.setLocale('zh_TW');
      resp.render('home', {title: "my title"});
    };
